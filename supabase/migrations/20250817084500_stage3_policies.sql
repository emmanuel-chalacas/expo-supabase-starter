-- Omnivia â€” Stage 3 Migration (Policies refinement)
-- Purpose: Refine RLS helper to include DP org hierarchy visibility; leave prior policies as-is.
-- Note: Supabase CLI wraps migrations in a transaction. Do not add BEGIN/COMMIT here.

-- Helper: using_rls_for_project(project_id)
-- Updated DP logic:
--   - dp_admin and dp_pm: visible via ORG membership OR any SUB_ORG under their partner_org
--   - dp_cp: visible only via exact SUB_ORG membership
create or replace function public.using_rls_for_project(p_project_id uuid)
